## [0.7.1] — 2026-05-20

Hotfix for a race condition in the MRP REFINE phase that surfaced while
compiling longer source documents (observed on
`meeting-notes-260519-2124-chien…`). No schema migration, no API change.

### Fixed

- **MRP REFINE concurrent-session race** — Phase 3 fanned out up to
  `MAX_WRITER_CONCURRENCY` page writers via `asyncio.gather`, all
  sharing the orchestrator's single `AsyncSession`. SQLAlchemy
  `AsyncSession` is not safe for concurrent use, so simultaneous
  `get_page_by_slug` lookups (UPDATE fetches plus the `read_kb_page`
  tool inside the complex writer's agent loop) raced and corrupted
  the session, causing intermittent draft generation failures on
  documents with several UPDATE pages or a large existing wiki.
  Each `_write_one` now opens its own session from
  `async_session_factory`; the orchestrator's session is reserved for
  the final `plan.plan_json` commit.

---

## [0.7.0] — 2026-05-19

Scaling the contribute/review workflow: review queue + bulk approve, author
trust signals, expertise-based reviewer routing, outline-aware diff,
gap-to-page deep-link, and external notification channels (email + webhook).
No schema migration — all features build on existing tables.

### Added

- **Review queue page (`/wiki/queue`)** listing every draft the current
  user can review across scopes, with status filter (pending /
  needs_revision / approved / rejected). Supports multi-select +
  bulk-approve; per-draft AI status chip, author trust chip, revision
  round, and submission age. Header button on `/wiki` deep-links here.
- **Bulk approve endpoint** `POST /wiki/drafts/bulk-approve` — processes
  each draft independently (per-item conflict / permission / not-found
  handling), commits the batch, and emits notifications for the
  approved set. Result payload reports approved / skipped / errored
  counts plus per-item messages.
- **Author trust signals** — `DraftResponse.author_stats` now exposes
  `{approved, rejected, needs_revision, total_reviewed, accuracy}` over
  the author's lifetime drafts. Banner and queue both render a chip
  coloured by tier (high / ok / low) with hover-tooltip detail.
- **Expertise-based reviewer suggestions** —
  `DraftResponse.suggested_reviewers` lists up to 3 employees ranked by
  past edit / approval activity on pages with overlapping
  `knowledge_type_slugs` OR in the same scope. Banner surfaces them so
  reviewers know who normally handles a topic.
- **Outline-aware diff view** — `WikiDraftDiff` groups hunks under their
  nearest preceding heading. Unchanged sections collapse automatically;
  changed sections stay open and are flagged in the section header.
  Pre-heading content (intro / frontmatter) renders ungrouped.
- **Knowledge-gap deep link** — the `/admin/statistics` Gaps tab's
  "Create draft →" link routes to `/wiki?new=1&title=<topic>`, which now
  auto-opens the create dialog with the gap topic pre-filled in the
  title field.
- **External notification channels (permissive)**
  - **Email (SMTP)**: per-recipient delivery; multiple notifications in
    the same request are batched into one email. Configured via
    `smtp_enabled / smtp_host / smtp_port / smtp_username / smtp_password
    / smtp_from / smtp_use_tls` keys in `app_config`. Sensitive keys
    (`smtp_password`) are encrypted at rest via the existing
    `ConfigService` Fernet layer.
  - **Webhook (generic JSON POST)**: single endpoint receives
    `{events: [{id, type, subject, body, target_type, target_id,
    recipient_id, actor_id, created_at}]}`. Optional HMAC secret signs
    the body in `X-Arkon-Signature: sha256=<hex>`.
  - Both channels run **after request commit** via a FastAPI middleware
    that drains a per-request notification staging buffer; errors are
    logged and swallowed so the contribution flow never breaks.
  - New settings panel **Notification channels** in `/settings` lets
    admins toggle each channel, edit credentials, and save without
    leaving the page.
- New runtime dependency: `aiosmtplib>=3.0.0` for async SMTP.

### Changed

- `_can_review_draft` is now the canonical reviewer-permission check;
  bulk-approve and the new queue both route through it so create drafts
  and edit drafts behave the same way.
- `notification_service.notify` / `notify_many` automatically stage
  every created `Notification` on the current request's contextvar; no
  per-route changes required for the new dispatch path.
- `_is_sensitive(key)` in `ConfigService` recognises `smtp_password` and
  `webhook_secret` so they round-trip encrypted.

### Deferred to 0.8

- Per-event channel routing (e.g. only ship `approved` events to email,
  send everything to the webhook).
- Auto-fast-track for high-trust authors (auto-approve after N hours
  with no review). Trust signals exist; the automation does not.
- Slack/Teams-native adapters (current webhook is intentionally generic).

## [0.6.0] — 2026-05-19

Contribute / review vision pass. Adds an AI pre-review layer that annotates
every wiki draft (PII, broken wikilinks, duplicates, tone / factual sniff),
a side-by-side diff view in the reviewer banner, and the ability for any
contributor to propose brand-new wiki pages. Permissive throughout — the AI
flags, the human decides.

### Added

- **AI pre-review (permissive)** for wiki drafts. Four layers run on every
  submit / resubmit:
  - **L1 regex (sync)** — emails, phone numbers, national IDs, AWS / GitHub /
    Anthropic / Google API keys, JWTs, private-key blocks. Suppressible
    inline with `<!-- pii-allow: <reason> -->` markers above the match.
  - **L2 structural (sync)** — broken wikilinks, self-links, length sanity,
    non-incremental heading jumps, unclosed code fences.
  - **L3 semantic (async)** — embedding similarity vs existing pages to
    flag potential duplicates (>0.85 cosine).
  - **L4 LLM judgment (async)** — tone consistency, page_type scope fit,
    factual concerns. Uses the admin-configured LLM via `ProviderRegistry`.
  - Results land in `wiki_page_drafts.ai_check_results` JSONB with a
    `summary` and per-check entries. Status flows
    `pending` → `running` → `passed` / `warned` / `failed`. **Nothing
    blocks submission** — every flag is advisory. Disable globally with
    the `ai_pre_review_enabled` config key.
- **Async worker task** `ai_pre_review_draft_task` registered in
  `WorkerSettings.functions`. L1/L2 run inside the request; L3/L4 are
  enqueued and update the draft when done.
- **Re-run on resubmit** — every author resubmission clears the AI state,
  re-runs L1+L2 synchronously, re-enqueues L3+L4, and snapshots the prior
  round's verdict to `wiki_draft_rounds.ai_check_results` so reviewers can
  compare across rounds.
- **Unified diff view** in the reviewer banner using `jsdiff`. New “Diff”
  tab (default) renders unified ± lines with word-level highlighting for
  changed lines and collapses long unchanged runs. Edit drafts only —
  create drafts have nothing to diff against.
- **AI check panel** appended below the diff/preview area. Collapsed shows
  a one-line summary chip + tally; expanded lists every warn / fail check
  with layer, message, and up to 5 example matches.
- **`propose_wiki_create` (REST + MCP)** lets any contributor propose a
  brand-new wiki page. The draft carries the suggested
  `{slug, title, page_type, knowledge_type_slugs, scope_type, scope_id}`;
  the parent page is materialised at approve time.
- **`create_wiki_page` (REST + MCP)** lets workspace editors and global
  `wiki:write:all` holders create pages directly without going through
  review.
- **Reviewer-side metadata overrides** on approve — `final_slug`,
  `final_title`, `final_page_type`, `final_knowledge_type_slugs` —
  applied when materialising a create draft. Slug collisions surface as
  HTTP 409 with a clear hint.
- **Polling for AI status** in the draft banner: while
  `ai_check_status ∈ {pending, running}` the component polls the draft
  every 3 seconds and refreshes the panel.

### Changed

- `WikiPageDraft.page_id` is now nullable — create drafts have no parent
  page until approval materialises one.
- `_can_review_draft` replaces page-keyed reviewer checks across all
  draft endpoints so create drafts route correctly to global / workspace
  reviewers without requiring an existing page.
- The `arkon-edit` skill documents the create flow + AI pre-review +
  `pii-allow` markers; `arkon-review` documents AI verdicts and metadata
  overrides on create-draft approval.

### Migrations

- `025_ai_pre_review_and_create_drafts.py` — adds
  `ai_check_status` / `ai_check_results` / `ai_checked_at` to
  `wiki_page_drafts`; adds `ai_check_results` to `wiki_draft_rounds`;
  adds `draft_kind` and `suggested_metadata` to `wiki_page_drafts`;
  makes `wiki_page_drafts.page_id` nullable.

### Deferred to 0.7

- Gap-driven page-creation suggestions (mining `mcp_query_log` zero-result
  searches for topics worth seeding pages from).
- Email / webhook notification channels (in-app only for now).
- Bulk-approve UI and a dedicated queue page.
- Trust / reputation signals and expertise-based reviewer routing.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-05-19

Contribute / review hardening, foundation pass. Adds a closed feedback loop
between authors and reviewers (`needs_revision`), an in-app notification
inbox, and a unified service for contribution state transitions across wiki
drafts and skill contributions. Lays the backbone for the upcoming AI
pre-review, diff view, and `propose_create_page` work in the next release.

### Added

- **`needs_revision` state for wiki drafts and skill contributions**: a
  reviewer can now send a draft back with a note instead of being forced to
  approve or reject. The author resubmits on the same draft —
  `revision_round` increments and the prior submission is snapshotted to
  the new `wiki_draft_rounds` table so reviewers can diff between rounds.
- **`withdraw` action for authors**: an in-flight draft (pending or
  needs_revision) can be retracted by its author without a reviewer touch.
- **`ContributionService` (`app/services/contribution_service.py`)**:
  thin state-machine wrapper with `WikiDraftAdapter` and
  `SkillContributionAdapter`. Each lifecycle verb fires audit logs and
  notifications uniformly so REST and MCP entry points behave the same.
- **`NotificationService` + in-app inbox**: new `notifications` table,
  `NotificationService` writer (sync DB inserts, audit_service pattern),
  REST endpoints `GET /notifications`, `GET /notifications/unread-count`,
  `POST /notifications/{id}/read`, `POST /notifications/read-all`.
- **NotificationBell in the header**: badge + slide-in drawer with
  mark-as-read controls; polls unread count every 30s.
- **MCP tools for the new lifecycle**:
  `request_changes_on_draft`, `resubmit_draft`, `withdraw_draft`. The
  matching skills (`arkon-edit`, `arkon-review`) document the new flow.
- **REST endpoints for wiki draft lifecycle**:
  `POST /wiki/drafts/{id}/request-changes`,
  `PATCH /wiki/drafts/{id}/content` (author resubmit),
  `POST /wiki/drafts/{id}/withdraw`,
  `GET /wiki/drafts/{id}/rounds` (per-round history).
- **REST endpoints for skill contribution lifecycle**:
  `POST /skill-contributions/{id}/request-changes`,
  `POST /skill-contributions/{id}/resubmit`,
  `POST /skill-contributions/{id}/withdraw`.
- **WikiDraftBanner UX**: distinct palette + headline for
  `needs_revision` vs `pending`, a “Request changes” button alongside
  Approve / Reject, the reviewer’s return note surfaced inline, a
  20-character minimum on rejection / request-changes notes, conflict
  badge when `base_version < page.version`, and a round counter when
  the draft has been through revisions.

### Changed

- **Skill contribution file edits no longer silently demote PENDING to
  DRAFT.** Contributors must explicitly `withdraw` (or wait for a reviewer
  to `request_changes`) before editing files on a contribution that is in
  front of a reviewer. This closes the “draft moves underfoot mid-review”
  hole flagged in the contribute/review code review.
- **Notifications fire on every lifecycle event** — submit, approve,
  reject, request_changes, resubmit, withdraw — across both REST and MCP
  entry points.

### Migrations

- `024_contribution_lifecycle.py`: adds `revision_round` /
  `last_returned_note` to `wiki_page_drafts` and `skill_contributions`,
  creates `wiki_draft_rounds` (per-round snapshots) and `notifications`
  (recipient-keyed inbox with `(recipient_id, read_at)` index for the
  badge query).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-18

A scope-aware refresh of the Wiki UX. Every wiki page already lived in a
scope (`global`, `department`, `project`), but the UI treated same-slug
pages from different scopes as duplicates and the index page only ever
showed the global catalog. This release threads scope context through
the URL, the page tree, the page detail view, and the ingestion pipeline.

### Added

- **Scope switcher on `/wiki`**: a dropdown listing the scopes the
  current user can access. Selecting a scope updates the URL
  (`/wiki?scope_type=&scope_id=`), refetches the matching `_index`
  catalog and pages grid, and is shareable / reloadable.
- **Scope-grouped page tree**: the sidebar in `/wiki` and the detail
  viewer now groups pages by scope (`GLOBAL`, plus each department),
  then by page type (`Entities`, `Concepts`, `Topics`, `Sources`).
  Clicking a scope header opens that scope's wiki landing; the chevron
  toggles expansion independently. The active scope and the bucket
  containing the active page auto-expand on navigation.
- **Scope-preserving navigation**: backlinks, outlinks, and inline
  `[[wikilinks]]` carry the current page's scope params, so jumping
  between related pages keeps the user inside the same scope context.
  The detail back button returns to `/wiki?scope_type=&scope_id=` for
  department-scoped pages (projects continue to return to
  `/workspaces`).
- **`GET /api/wiki/my-scopes`**: lists global plus each department and
  project the requester can read. Used by the scope switcher.
- **`scope_name` in wiki responses**: `/api/wiki/pages` joins the
  `Project` and `Department` tables so each summary carries a
  human-readable scope name (e.g. `"Phòng Nhân sự"`) alongside the raw
  ID, removing the need for separate lookups on the client.
- **Thematic-section concept pages during ingestion**: the MRP
  extraction and planning prompts now recognise documents that describe
  a primary entity through several distinct themes (e.g. *Product
  Positioning*, *Target Customer Profile*, *Content Pillars*) and emit
  a separate `concept` page per theme instead of dumping the content
  into the entity page. The entity page links out to them with
  `[[concept/...]]`.

### Changed

- `/api/wiki/pages` and `/api/wiki/index` accept optional
  `scope_type` + `scope_id` query parameters. When omitted the original
  behaviour is preserved (RBAC-filtered list, global index).
- `ScopeBadge` accepts `scopeId: string | null` to match the relaxed
  `WikiPageSummary` type.
- Sidebar collapse/expand chevrons swapped for `left_panel_close` /
  `left_panel_open` icons that don't look like a Back button.
- The `/wiki` page tree no longer surfaces project-scoped pages —
  workspaces remain reachable from `/workspaces` and from the scope
  switcher, keeping the wiki sidebar focused on enterprise-wide
  knowledge.
- The wiki graph no longer draws the dashed convex-hull boundaries
  around department and project clusters; nodes and edges stand on
  their own.
- The `Wiki` button previously added to department cards was removed
  once the scope switcher and clickable tree scope headers landed —
  redundant entry points were creating clutter.

### Fixed

- Department-scoped detail pages no longer fetch
  `/api/projects/<id>/wiki` (which 404s on department IDs); the tree
  uses the new general scope-aware `/api/wiki/pages` endpoint instead.
- Clicking a backlink, outlink, or inline `[[wikilink]]` from a scoped
  page used to drop scope context and load the flat "old" tree.
- Navigating to a global wiki page used to render with the legacy flat
  tree while `/wiki` showed the new grouped tree.
- `DELETE /api/wiki/pages/<slug>` returned 404 for workspace pages
  because the endpoint looked them up with the default global scope.
  Even after that lookup was fixed, the cascade helper re-fetched the
  row with the same default and silently no-op'd the actual delete,
  returning `{"ok": true}` while the row remained in the database.
  `delete_page_cascade` now takes the resolved `WikiPage` object so
  no second lookup is performed.
- The summary block under the page title piped `page.summary` straight
  into ReactMarkdown without the `[[wikilink]]` preprocessing step
  used by the main content renderer, so users saw raw `[[Arkon]]` and
  bare `**...**` markers in the header of every page. Wikilinks now
  resolve through the same preprocessor and inherit the active scope.

### Backend

- Frontend `WikiPageSummary` and Pydantic `WikiPageSummary` both gain
  `scope_name: Optional[str]`; new shared `WikiScope` type for the
  switcher payload.
- `_build_wiki_scope_filter` is reused by both `/wiki/pages` and the
  new `/wiki/my-scopes` endpoint.
- `regenerate_index` is called with the deleted page's actual scope so
  the right `_index` is rebuilt after a non-global delete.

---

## [0.3.1] — 2026-05-14

### Added

- **Wiki Graph — Department Clustering**: Wiki pages scoped to a department now visually group into department clusters on the `/wiki/graph` canvas.
  - Convex hull drawn per department (below project hulls) with a distinct color per department.
  - Force simulation biases nodes toward their department's X-zone (70% scope pull, 30% component spread) so related pages naturally converge.
  - Legend lists each department with icon `business` and page count.
  - Tooltip shows department name for dept-scoped pages.

### Fixed

- Graph endpoint now joins the `Department` table so `scope_name` is populated for department-scoped pages (previously only `Project` was joined, leaving dept nodes without a name label).

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-13

### Added

- **Department-level Wiki Isolation**: Wiki pages compiled from department-scoped sources are now restricted to members of that department.
  - `ScopeType.DEPARTMENT` added to the enum; pipeline `_resolve_wiki_scopes()` resolves project > department(s) > global, fanning out multi-department sources into one page per department scope (LLM runs once, content is duplicated to each scope).
  - `wiki_service._scope_filter_with_dept()` provides a single-query OR filter (global + user's department).
  - `get_wiki_page` returns HTTP 403 for cross-department access.
  - Source PATCH: changing department on a `ready` source triggers wiki detach, old-scope index regeneration, and MRP re-queue automatically.
  - Frontend: edit-source dialog warns before department reassignment triggers re-analysis.

- **MRP Pipeline — Plan Regeneration with Reviewer Feedback**: Admin can now reject a pending plan with a note, triggering LLM-based regeneration that incorporates the feedback.
  - `POST /sources/{id}/plan/regenerate` runs in the background via `regenerate_plan_task`.
  - Plan Review Dialog surfaces a *Regenerate* button that requires a reviewer note.
  - `_resolve_maybe_items` uses LLM to decide UPDATE vs CREATE (previously always downgraded MAYBE to CREATE).

- **Catalog-driven LLM & Vision Selection**: Replaces free-form `llm_provider + llm_model_id` config with curated catalogs (`LLMModelSpec`, `VisionModelSpec`) that expose context window size, tool support, vision capability, and per-token cost.
  - `/api/settings/{llm,vision}/{catalog,switch}` endpoints mirror the embedding catalog pattern.
  - Settings UI renders a `ModelCatalogCard` per capability with metadata (context window, costs, tool/vision badges).
  - `writer._get_source_context_budget` reads `context_window_tokens` from the spec — the stale hard-coded table is removed.

- **Gemini Model Updates**: Catalog updated with newer Gemini variants.
  - `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`: 1M context, tools + vision + thinking, cheapest Google 1M option ($0.25 in / $1.50 out per 1M tokens). New recommended default for high-volume extraction and captioning.
  - `gemini-3-flash-preview` and two additional preview models added.
  - Admins on `gemini-3.1-flash` must reselect in Settings (model removed from catalog).

### Fixed

- **MRP Pipeline Hardening** (critical):
  - Draft results (`PageWriteResult`) now persisted in `plan_json._page_drafts`; VERIFY/COMMIT phases resume without re-running REFINE.
  - `caption_images_task` is now serialized before `ingest_map_reduce_task`, baking captions into `source.full_text` before MAP runs — fixes the race condition that produced empty image markers in compiled wiki pages.
  - KB reconciliation searches every destination scope and retains the best semantic match, preventing duplicate pages when the same concept exists across scopes.

- **MRP Pipeline Hardening** (high):
  - `assemble_evidence` uses word-boundary regex (`\bterm\b`) instead of substring matching, so short entity names (e.g. "AI") no longer match unrelated subjects ("MAIL").
  - `/sources/{id}/plan/regenerate` runs async via arq; UI polls `GET /plan` instead of holding an open HTTP connection.
  - JSON fence stripping unified via `parse_json_loose`; removes several incorrect `str.strip("```json")` variants in mapper and wiki_analyzer.

- **MRP Pipeline Hardening** (medium):
  - Approve/reject/regenerate endpoints use `SELECT FOR UPDATE` and reject mismatched status to prevent race conditions.
